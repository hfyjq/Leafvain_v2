Platform capability protocols.

Inspired by kirara-ai's ``@runtime_checkable`` pattern.  Protocols let
the pipeline (or other channels) test what a channel supports without
knowing its concrete type:

    if isinstance(channel, FileReceiveCapable):
        chain = await channel.receive_file(update.message)
